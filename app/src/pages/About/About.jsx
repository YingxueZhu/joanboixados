        I wonder why did I create this section. I'm Joan and I live in
        Barcelona. It's nice here. I created this page to show some of the
        pictures I take when on my solo roadtrips. Oh, those are nice too.
        </p>
        <p>
        I want to do many things, I do some. I showcase even less here. Normally
        I write or speak too much, so I am trying to be brief here. I also
        give too many explanations. I studied computer science and worked in
        the web application development world. I have many interests, none of
        which I master. I like squirrels and to ask questions.
        </p>
        <p>
        I think this will do. If you feel like it would be nice to get in touch,
        feel free to say hi! from the left menu. Passi-ho b√©.
